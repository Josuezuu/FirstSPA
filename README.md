SPA | Universe


This is my first SPA project developed on Stage 06 of "Rocketseat - Explorer".
The goal here is to create an SPA with routes using javascript.


 Functionalities:
- At the "home" page, go to "universe" when the button "Saiba mais" is clicked.

- Navigate between pages using their buttons.

- Navigate between pages using browser's "previous and next page" buttons.



Languages used:

-HTML
-CSS
-JavaScript
